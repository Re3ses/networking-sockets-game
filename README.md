# Running The Game

To run the game you will need to run an instane of _server.py_ on one machine. Then you can run instances of _run.py_ on other machines to connect.

You will need to change the **server** address in both _server.py_ and _network.py_ to be the IPV4 address of your machine or the server ips you'll be using.
